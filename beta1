On one dark, stormy night, {boy} came along. He was wearing nothing but a {cloth_article}.
He went into the woods and there he found a {creature}! It was {adj }.
In fright he ran into a nearby village called {village} screaming, "{exclamation}!"
The footsteps of the {creature} behind him became louder and louder.
The villagers screamed, "It's a {adj} {creature}!" 
Taking no prisoners the {creature} demolished the entire village leaving only the trace of someone's {fav_thing}.  
Then it went back into the woods and waited for its next victim to emerge.
